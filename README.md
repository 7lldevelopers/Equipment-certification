Simulating authentication relationships between devices
A trusted identity of an Internet of Things device, which has security attributes that cannot be tampered with or forged. It is a key infrastructure for realizing the interconnection of all things and service circulation.
+ Device identity: Provide a corresponding identity for each IoT device, and provide two-way identity authentication services based on ID to prevent devices from being tampered with or counterfeited.

+ Secure connection: Provides lightweight security protocols  compatible with TLS and DTLS. More suitable for IoT devices, it can significantly reduce the resource consumption of IoT devices while ensuring security.

+ Business data protection: Keys derived based on the device's trusted root support multiple encryption algorithms to provide security protection for sensitive data such as device firmware, business data, and application authorization.

+ Key management: Provide centralized management of keys used by devices, applications, and businesses in the IoT system, including key generation, key destruction, and end-to-end key secure distribution.
